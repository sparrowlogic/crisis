## open source collaboration to help match individual needs up with NGOs who can voluntarily provide relief.

### Core concepts:
* Need Request: This represents a request for a certain type of need (e.g., food) to be fulfilled.
* Need Type: An entity that represents a type of need such as medical care, food, water, or other basic needs.
* Volunteer: An organization or individual who subscribes to need requests in a certain geographic region filtered by Need Type (e.g., food).
* PromiseToHelp: A commitment from a Volunteer to meet the need being requested in its entirety.

### Authentication:
* Keep things simple. Validate via e-mail like other online listing services for publishing need requests to reduce spam.
* Volunteers have a richer experience -- authentication may be required here.

### Accountability concepts:
* Problem statement: With respect to accountability -- Many NGOs have an ambiguous accountability structure and as a potential donor that makes evaluating who to provide charity to. When I donate money to something I want to be sure it's actually helping someone in need rather than filling the personal coffers of NGO executive staff and contributing to a marketing plan. I envision a donation mechanism that's tied to the end-recipient acknowledging that they got something from the volunteering party.


With Crisis, Volunteers are held accountable by NeedRequestors *confirming receipt of a Promise To Help when they receive what they requested*. Need Requestors present a the token that supplier can fulfill.
